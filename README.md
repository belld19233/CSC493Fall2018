This project was put together using Bootstrap 4, Google Chrome, and the Brackets text editor. To view the website, it must be hosted on the local machine or another service, however you can also use the Brackets live view function. All CSS files are named after the html page they are paired with. Images of people follow the naming convention of (first initial)(last name).(extension). Currently there are no custom identifiers for html objects, such as cards (sourced from Bootstrap). While the project is based on Bootstrap, it is not optimized for mobile.
